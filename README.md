# Charts

These are some of that charts from the Charts.js Library.

There are 9 types of charts that I have tried to understand:
 - Area Chart
 - Bar Chart
 - Bubble Chart
 - Doughnut and Pie Chart
 - Line Chart
 - Mixed Chart
 - Polar Chart
 - Radar Chart
 - Scatter Chart

I have used data from their demos/documentation to get an understanding of how to implement their api into a website.
